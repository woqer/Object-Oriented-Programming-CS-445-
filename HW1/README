This is a Ruby project! So Ruby (1.9.3 at least) needs to be installed in the system.

Installing in Ubuntu (needs internet connection):
	$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3

For now on, it is assumed that you are working on the project directory.

Information of directory hierarchy in the memo file (memo/memo.pdf)

Running the acceptance test is just:
	$ ruby TestCreatures.rb

For the Unit Test and the Coverage, some gems need to be installed.
Internet connection is needed for this step.
GemFile is provided so just run:
	$ bundle install

Running the Unit Tests:
	$ rspec spec/

The test results will be in the folder ./coverage in HTML format
(open coverage/index.html with any web browser).
If any error is found in the test, it will be printed in the terminal
